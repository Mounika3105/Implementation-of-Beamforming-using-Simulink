# Implementation-of-Beamforming-using-Simulink
Beamforming is one of the major techniques involved in increasing the data rates by increasing the Signal to Noise Ratio. This project aims to develop a model for the same in Simulink which could be further connected to FPGA to check for the transmission of the signal.
